      Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always
    there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid
    mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard
    to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may
    not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not
    easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought
     about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.
