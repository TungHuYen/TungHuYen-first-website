  <h2>poem</h2>
  <br>Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always
there to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid
mistakes and they look out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard
to find, but they offer a friendship that will last a lifetime. Other friends may
not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal is not
easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought
 about by a loving friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.</br>
